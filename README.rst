Stacktrace
==========

This library allows you to print the stacktrace just like Python, with
filenames, line numbers, function names and the line itself.

It works for shared libraries too.

Prerequisites
-------------

The only requirement is the ``binutils`` package. On Ubuntu, do::

    sudo apt-get install binutils-dev
